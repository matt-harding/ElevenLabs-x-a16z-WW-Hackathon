I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about Meta layoffs in China. The search results provided don't contain details about layoffs specifically targeting Meta's operations in China. The layoffs mentioned appear to be part of a broader global restructuring effort by Meta, affecting employees in various countries, but China is not explicitly mentioned.

The layoffs described in the search results are part of Meta's company-wide performance-based cuts announced in early 2025, affecting approximately 3,600 employees or about 5% of Meta's global workforce[1][3]. These cuts were primarily aimed at employees deemed as "low performers" according to the company, though many affected employees have disputed this characterization[9].

The layoffs appear to be affecting various departments across Meta, including engineering, data center operations, and other roles[2]. However, without more specific information about Meta's operations in China, I cannot provide details about which departments or roles might be affected there.

If you're looking for information specifically about Meta's operations or potential layoffs in China, I would need additional sources focused on that topic to provide accurate information. The current search results don't contain that level of detail for China specifically.
