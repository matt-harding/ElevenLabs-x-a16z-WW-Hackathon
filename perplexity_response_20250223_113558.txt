I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about Meta announcing new layouts or any issues related to that. The search results don't contain details about a recent Meta announcement regarding layouts that would be causing concerns.

The closest relevant information I found is about a "Layout" utility app for Meta Quest VR headsets, mentioned in result [10]. This app allows users to redesign their real-world spaces in VR, but it doesn't seem to be related to any broader announcement or issues with Meta's platforms.

If you're experiencing specific problems with Meta's products or services, could you provide more details about what exactly you're encountering? That would help me better understand your situation and potentially offer more relevant information or advice.
