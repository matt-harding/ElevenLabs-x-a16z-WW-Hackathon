As an example, there’s a project called Jensen, which is building a crowdsourced compute layer. As a startup, you can submit a job that goes beyond the compute you control, and it gets distributed across a network—kind of Airbnb-style—to people with excess compute. The network manages supply and demand.  That’s the economic ledger.  Yeah, that’s one example. Another is Story Protocol, which is a new way to register intellectual property. You can create an image, video, or piece of music and register it on a blockchain, which keeps a record of the media and its rights. It uses existing copyright law—the blockchain record mirrors a legal agreement crafted to work internationally. Anyone can come along and, as long as they abide by your terms, use the content. You might say, “You can use this, you can remix it, you can create derivative works, but any revenue you make, you have to pay me 10%.” ",

A recurring theme in blockchain is composability. I have a chapter in my book on this—it’s a powerful force and the core reason for open-source software’s success. Open-source software has been the most successful open computing movement in the last 80 years. Linux went from 0% market share in the ’90s to over 90% today because of composability. People contribute small pieces to a system, making it better—like Wikipedia as a collective knowledge system.  Story Protocol creates the same kind of Lego brick effect for media. Someone creates a character, someone else creates another, someone else remixes them, and AI tools allow for generative AI storytelling.

The question is, how do we use these systems to gather more data for AI? Data can be an input, model evaluation, or something else. It’s similar to what companies like Scale AI do, but in a crowdsourced rather than centralized way.  A project we invested in, co-founded by Sam Altman, is WorldCoin. The thesis is that in a world where AI can replicate humans and content, we need a way to prove someone is human. The best way to do that is cryptographically using a blockchain.  Their incentive system allows people to sign up. Originally, they used an orb to scan irises, which some found controversial. Now, they offer other methods, including passports. The idea is that once you prove your identity, you receive cryptographic proof on a blockchain, which can be used for various services.  A simple example is CAPTCHAs. Today, you solve puzzles that have become so complex they may no longer be AI-proof—or even human-proof. Instead of clunky fraud prevention systems, you could use cryptographic verification. You receive a cryptographic code, proving you’re human, and then layer additional verifications on top.  That’s another interesting intersection.  There are many opportunities at the infrastructure layer—taking centralized AI systems and decentralizing them in terms of code and services. There are also new possibilities, like machine-to-machine payments. Then there are the more ambitious ideas, which I find the most exciting—new business models for an AI-powered world, particularly for creative people.  Breaking the economic pact of the internet",

Specifically, over the last 20 years, an economic covenant has emerged between platforms—specifically social networks and search engines—and the people creating websites that those platforms link to. If you’re a travel website, a recipe site, or an artist with illustrations, there’s an implicit covenant with Google. You allow Google to crawl your content, index it, and show snippets in search results in exchange for traffic. That’s how the internet evolved. ",

On the crypto side, one area I’m excited about is DPIN—decentralized physical infrastructure. The most prominent example is Helium, a community-owned, crowdsourced telecom network that competes with Verizon and AT&T. Helium created an incentive system where anyone can set up a node at home, contributing to the network. These nodes function as wireless transmitters, and hundreds of thousands of people across the country have installed them.  Now, Helium offers a cellular service that is significantly cheaper than Verizon’s—$20 per month instead of $70—because much of the network runs on this community-built infrastructure rather than requiring tens of billions of dollars to construct.

Now they have that, which creates all kinds of second-order effects—including in politics and society at large.  For AI, the first stage is the skeuomorphic phase. This is where we see AI replacing existing jobs, like customer service roles. Instead of a human in a call center, you have an AI-powered chatbot. It’s a one-to-one replacement—cheaper, more systematic, and disruptive to jobs. Hopefully, it will also create more and better jobs, but this is the first, obvious phase.  People get excited about AI’s potential because they see this phase affecting tens of millions of jobs.

Buying something online was more convenient than using a paper catalog, but fundamentally, it wasn’t new.  The native phase began in the 2000s with social networking—an entirely new behavior with no offline equivalent. Facebook started as a digital yearbook, but as it evolved into the News Feed and beyond, it became something entirely new.

When you create something new, broader changes follow. Social networking is a good example. It rose in the 2000s, and by the 2008 and 2012 Obama elections, it had reached a tipping point. News articles at the time noted how different it was—how social media had shifted from secondary to primary.  Then we started seeing unexpected societal shifts. Movements like Trump’s populism surprised many. Behavior changed in ways we still don’t fully understand, and we’re in a state of disequilibrium.  Social media’s second-order effects are still playing out. Crypto and other emerging movements today are arguably second-order effects of social media. These effects could unfold over the next 20 to 30 years. That will likely be phase three of the AI revolution. ",

Maybe fresh upstarts in other countries will create AI-native movie studios, but that will take time.  The right approach is probably to integrate AI with existing Hollywood talent, not replace it. There are many highly skilled people in the industry. But how long will that cultural shift take? It may require an entirely new generation.
