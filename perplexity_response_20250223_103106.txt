I apologize, but there appears to be some confusion in your query. Based on the available information, there is no Stargate project between Google and Microsoft. The Stargate Project you may be referring to is actually a joint venture involving different companies, not Google and Microsoft. Let me clarify the details:

The Stargate Project is a $500 billion initiative announced in January 2025, aimed at building advanced AI infrastructure in the United States[1][3]. The key participants in this project are:

1. OpenAI (operational responsibility)
2. SoftBank (financial responsibility)
3. Oracle
4. MGX (an investment firm)

Microsoft is involved as a technology partner, along with Arm and NVIDIA, but is not a primary leader of the project[1][3].

The main objectives of the Stargate Project include:

1. Securing American leadership in AI technology[5][7].
2. Creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs[1][7].
3. Generating significant economic benefits for the US and globally[5][7].
4. Supporting the re-industrialization of the United States[5].
5. Enhancing national security by developing strategic AI capabilities[5].

The project aims to achieve these goals by investing in building state-of-the-art data centers across the United States, with the first site already under construction in Abilene, Texas[3][4]. These data centers will be used to train and operate advanced AI systems, particularly for OpenAI's development of more powerful AI models[3][8].
