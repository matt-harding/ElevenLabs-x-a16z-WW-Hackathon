I apologize, but I'm not sure which specific part of a speech or event you're referring to. The search results provided contain general information about speech structure and organization, but don't mention any particular speech or event. Could you please provide more context about what you're looking for? Are you asking about a specific speech, or do you need general information about speech structure and context? I'd be happy to try to clarify or provide more relevant information if you can give me some additional details.
