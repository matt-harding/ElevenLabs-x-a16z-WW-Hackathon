I apologize, but I don't have any specific details about a particular company or organization conducting mass layoffs. The search results provide general information about layoffs in 2025 and guidelines for conducting layoffs, but don't mention a specific company. To provide more accurate information, I would need additional context about which company or organization you're inquiring about. Is there a particular company or industry you're interested in learning more about regarding layoffs?
